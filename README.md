# Circular van Krevelen diagram for visualizing metabolic pathways

We postulate that a coordinate system based on elemental ratios can support a new generation of metabolic pathway visualization at the interface between humans and computers. An new human metabolic map is presented in this paper as proof of principle. 

This repo includes code, map release, GSMMs of human and E. coli.
